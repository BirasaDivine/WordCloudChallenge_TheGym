# DOM Practice - Word Cloud Challenge

The file **cloud.html** contains a paragraph of text.

In this paragraph, find the 12 most often occurring words, and put them in a word cloud below the paragraph.

If you do not know what a word cloud is, here is an example:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6f49f27-a252-499a-96e2-c9a268a030f3)

The most often occurring word should have a font size of 64px. The second most often occurring word should have a font size of 60px. The third most often occurring word should have a font size of 56px. And so on, down to the 12th most often occurring word with a font size of 20px.

Other stylings are completely up to you! Colors, arrangement, how the words are flipped - that's your decision.

You may edit **cloud.html**, **cloud.js**, and **cloud.css**.
